# An all-sky Red Clump star catalogue using Gaia & AllWISE

This is a part of the [_GaiaUnlimited_](https://github.com/gaia-unlimited) project.

This folder shows a worked example of fitting a Galactic disc model to a mock sample of Red Clump stars. The notebook generates the mock disc, applies an extinction model, and computes the appropriate selection function, to carry out the fit to recover the true parameters. The details are described in a forthcoming paper by Shourya Khanna et al. (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241022036K/abstract)
