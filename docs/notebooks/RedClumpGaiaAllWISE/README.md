# An all-sky Red Clump star catalogue using Gaia & AllWISE

This is a part of the [_GaiaUnlimited_](https://github.com/gaia-unlimited) project.

This *folder* shows a worked example of fitting a Galactic disc model to a mock sample of Red Clump stars. The notebook 'RC_galfit_demo.ipynb' generates the mock disc, applies an extinction model, and computes the appropriate selection function, to carry out the fit to recover the true parameters. The details are described in a forthcoming paper by Shourya Khanna et al. (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241022036K/abstract)
The subdirectory 'rcdemo' contains all the dependencies needed for the execution of the notebook. It is also where temporary dirctories are generated and figures will be saved in.

* temporarily the notebook and tools are made available at  https://github.com/gaia-unlimited/gaiaunlimited/blob/main/docs/notebooks/RedClumpGaiaAllWISE/README.md
