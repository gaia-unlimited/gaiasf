# An all-sky Red Clump star catalogue using Gaia & AllWISE

This is a part of the [_GaiaUnlimited_](https://github.com/gaia-unlimited) project.

This folder will hold the worked example of the construction of the selection function for a sample of Red Clump stars selected on the basis of Gaia and AllWISE data. The details are described in a forthcoming paper by Shourya Khanna et al.
