    "\n",
    "Simply put, a selection function of a given subset gives probabilities that a source in the parent set gets included in the subset as a function of its properties such as sky coordinates, apparent magnitude, color, etc. Thus, it should always return a value between 0 and 1, and it is always concerned with a particular subset of interest defined by one or more conditions.\n",

    "![sf-diagram](_static/sf-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the parent set is all that is out there and the subset under consideration is what makes it into the Gaia source table (`gaia_source`) of a particular data release, say, DR3, this selection function is what we will refer to as DR3 survey selection function. The selection probability of this selection function summarizes all of the complicated processes involved in data taking and processing."

    "\n",
    "In short, whenever you are interested in counting! Whenever we want to answer a question or constrain a model through data comparison, and when that model predicts densities, rates, or other incidences for objects with certain characteristics ([Rix et al. 2021][Rix2021]). If we are interested in how many of something are really there using an incomplete data, we want to know and account for how (in)complete the data is."

    "- **Survey Selection Function** which is an estimate of the probability that a source is included in the Gaia's data release (i.e., in that release's `gaia_source` table) as a function of sky coordinates and Gaia G magnitudes.\n",
    "- **Subsample Selection Function** which is an estimate of the probability that a source already in `gaia_source` is included in the subsample of interest (e.g., sources with RVs). We define these selection functions as a function of sky coordinates, Gaia G, and Gaia G - Gaia G_RP color.\n",

    "These two different types of selection functions are meant to be multiplied to yield the selection function for the subsample of Gaia that one is interested in.
